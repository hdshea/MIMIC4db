# MIMIC4db

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This work references data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care MIMIC-IV database. 
MIMIC-IV is a large, freely-available database comprising de-identified health-related data from patients who
were admitted to the critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001-2019.  Detailed
information can be obtained on the [MIMIC-IV website](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/).

MIMIC4db provides a tightly bound set of routines to reference the Google BigQuery version of the [MIMIC-IV v1.0](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.0/) database using 
base access routines from the [DBI](https://github.com/r-dbi/DBI) R package with an appropriate [bigrquery](https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery) DBIConnection. 

## Installation

You can install MIMIC4db from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hdshea/MIMIC4db")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MIMIC4db)
# To run examples, you must have the BIGQUERY_TEST_PROJECT environment
# variable set to name of project which has billing set up and to which
# you have write access.

## basic example code
```
