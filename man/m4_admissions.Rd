\description{
This function provides base access to the admissions table containing information regarding a patientâ€™s
admission to the hospital. Since each unique hospital visit for a patient is assigned a unique \code{hadm_id},
the admissions table can be considered as a definition table for \code{hadm_id}. Information available includes
timing information for admission and discharge, demographic information, the source of the admission, and so on.

Table attributes for admissions table:
